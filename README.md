# Cocoapods Dependency Manager

CococaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods handles many workflows automatically that developers would normally need to perform manually, including:  

* Fetching dependency source code
* Recursively resolve and merge dependencies
* Integrate source code, linker flags, library paths, header paths, etc.
* Manage dependency life-cycle
  - Installing new dependencies
  - Updating dependencies
  - Removing dependencies

CocoaPods has become the standard for dependency management, and even [Google embraced it](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/05/28/google-is-embracing-cocoapods-to-bring-its-services-to-ios-developers/) as their standard for delivering tools to iOS developers.

##Consuming CocoaPods
CocoaPods enables software developers to quickly and easily integrate 3rd-party libraries, called Pods.

##Producing CocoaPods
Anyone can use CocoaPods to bundle and share their code with other developers.
