# Cocoapods Dependency Manager

CococaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods automatically handles many workflows that developers previously needed to perform manually, including:  

* Fetch source code
* Recursively Resolve and merge dependencies
* Integrates source code, linker flags, library paths, header paths, etc.
* Managing dependency life-cycle
  - Adding dependencies
  - Updating dependencies
  - Removing dependencies

CocoaPods has becoming the standard for dependency management, and even Google embraced it as their standard for delivering tools to iOS developers.
