#Development Environment

Cococapods is used exclusively by Cocoa developers (iOS and Mac apps) therefore it can only be used on the Mac OS X operating system and with [Xcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) Integrated Development Environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)).

CocoaPods is a command-line tool but a basic graphical user-interface exists [as an Xcode Plugin](https://github.com/kattrali/cocoapods-xcode-plugin).
