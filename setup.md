###Setup

####Install CocoaPods
CocoaPods should be installed using Ruby, which comes pre-installed on Mac OS X. Run the following command at the terminal.  
```sudo gem install cocoapods```

####Updating CocoaPods
CocoaPods is an open-source project in active-development and updates are frequently released. To make sure you are running the latest version of CocoaPods, you can update via Ruby Gems.  
```sudo gem update cocoapods```

####Xcode Plugin
If you prefer to interact with CocoaPods using a GUI instead of the terminal, you can install an Xcode Plugin which adds a CocoaPods menu to Xcode. The plugin is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/kattrali/cocoapods-xcode-plugin).
