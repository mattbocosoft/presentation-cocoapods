#Searching for CocoaPods

There are  (*as of 30 September 2015*) more than 11,000 CocoaPods publicly available. Each CocoaPod is registered via a Podspec, which is a specification that describes a version of a CocoaPod. Here is the official repository of Podspecs: https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/tree/master/Specs

Below are a variety of options to help search for and discover CocoaPods.

##"pod search" command
In the terminal, type <code>'pod search \<query\>'</code> where \<query\> represents the keyword(s) you are searching for.

Use <code>pod search --help</code> for more information.

##CocoaPods Homepage
The [CocoaPods homepage](https://cocoapods.org) offers a search field to look for CocoaPods by name, version, author, keywords, summary or dependencies.

##Looking for Podspecs
Keep an eye out for Podspecs in the root directory of libraries you would like to use. CocoaPods is fast becoming the standard method for Cocoa Dependency Management, so most popular libraries offer a Podspec.

##Other sources
Additionally, there are some 3rd-party resources which can help you sift through the almost 12,000 CocoaPods currently available.
