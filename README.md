# Cocoapods Dependency Manager

CococaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. CocoaPods automatically handles the following parts of the dependency life-cycle:
* Fetching dependency source code
* Resolving and merging dependencies recursively
* Integrates source code, linker flags, and build configuration
* Support dependency life-cycle
  - Adding dependencies
  - Updating dependencies
  - Removing dependencies


CocoaPods enables software developers to quickly and easily integrate 3rd-party libraries, called Pods.
